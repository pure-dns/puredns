# PureDNS

PureDNS is a secure DNS resolver designed specifically for users in Indonesia. When you browse the internet, your device needs to translate domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses. This process is called DNS resolution. PureDNS handles this translation securely, protecting your privacy and ensuring unrestricted access to the internet.

## Our Mission

Beyond providing a free DNS service, PureDNS is part of an effort to improve internet security literacy in Indonesia. By making encrypted DNS accessible and easy to understand, we aim to educate users about online privacy, help them understand how their internet connection works, and empower them to take control of their digital security.

## Why Indonesia?

PureDNS was created to address specific challenges faced by internet users in Indonesia:

- **Bypass DNS-based blocking** without needing a VPN.
- **Servers optimized for low latency** from Indonesia.
- **Free and accessible** to everyone.
